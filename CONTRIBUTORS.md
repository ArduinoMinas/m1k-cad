To be explicit, the ADALM1000 would not be the system it is today without the labor of a number of people, both inside Analog Devices and out. [I](https://github.com/itdaniher) would like to thank the many talented individuals who offered, at various points in time, everything from schematic review, troubleshooting assistance, PCB design, component selection suggestions, supply chain management, graphic design, etc.

In no particular order, a partial list of those who have contributed to the design is included below.

 * Earl Conda
 * Dave Babicz
 * Charly El-Khoury
 * Robin Getz
 * Jas Gohlar
 * Aaron Hanson
 * Bob Macdonald
 * Kevin Mehall
 * Den Morales
 * Jon Pearson
 * Luca Vassalli
 * Hong Yao
 * Mei Wang
 * and many more
